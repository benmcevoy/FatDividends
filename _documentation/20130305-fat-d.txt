the blog is a blog is a blog
data administration happens offline

generates JSON data sets to file
widgets are javascript widgets
	.js
	.js templates/html
	.css
again just static content
consume the .JSON generated above

client does the heavy work
server requirements are minimal, can even be Linux-Apache
as it's all static

admin is
	some app (MVC/WPF who cares)
	some database (SQL CE who cares)
	templates + data to render JSON 
		render (Razor + model -> html)
		preview(just open in browser)
		export (ftp that shit up)

The thing i wanted to build for myself...

BUT how does file store work for related pdf etc?
How is this EASY to administer?
it's certainly cheap to run....
