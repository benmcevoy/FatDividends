    <content><![CDATA[<p class="h1"><span>Market Summary April 24th 2013</span></p>
<p>The Aussie market was on fire today up 86 points to close at 5,102 points.  The talk of further rate cutting and a good lead from overseas on profit results help lift the financials to grind higher.  The Dollar was flat for the day and at the time of publishing, Europe has opened mostly flat.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank <a href="/stock-information/cba">CBA</a>, ANZ <a href="/stock-information/anz">ANZ</a>, Westpac Bank <a href="/stock-information/WBC">WBC</a>, and National Australia Bank, <a href="/stock-information/nab">NAB</a> were up between 2.2 and 2.4%.  A shot in the arm from interest rate speculation and with ANZ <a href="/stock-information/anz">ANZ</a> reporting profits early next week has provided good gains for dividend investors.</p>
<p>Mining and Energy sectors were also up with BHP Billiton <a href="/stock-information/bhp">BHP</a> up 1% to $31.70, Rio Tinto <a href="/stock-information/rio">RIO</a> up 1.3% to $54.68.  Woodside <a href="/stock-information/wpl">WPL</a> again was up 2.1% to $38.74 giving investors further cheer.</p>
<p>Retail also fared well with Harvey Norman <a href="/stock-information/hvn">HVN</a> rising over 4% for two days in a row.  Myer <a href="/stock-information/myr">MYR</a>, JB Hifi <a href="/stock-information/JBH">JBH</a> and David Jones <a href="/stock-information/DJS">DJS</a> were also higher, with The Reject Shop <a href="/stock-information/TRS">TRS</a> up 7.8% to $18.02 after announcing a share placement to help fund its growth plans.</p>
<p>With tomorrow being ANZAC day it gives us a day to reflect on the things that matter and the people who have sacrificed all they have for us. </p>
<p class="h1"><span>Morning Report April 24th 2013</span></p>
<p>Wall street was up strongly overnight and European markets were much higher with euro indexs up over 2% on much lower Italian and Spanish bond yields. The Dow, Nasdaq and SP 500 finished 14,719 3.269 and 1,579 respectivily broadly all 1% higher. US banks were higher and after the bell Yum Brands beat estimates and Apple increased its dividned to shareholders and increasing its buyback to $50 Billion. During the day a fake tweet about a bomb going off in the white house caused the market to drop over 100 points, but a few minutes later all the points were regained.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar was slightly higher at 1.026 and the SPI futures are up around 50 points which sounds like a great day ahead. Woodside might further be in the news today with its AGM being held in Perth later today. Copper was again lower 1% and Brent crude seems to be stable around $100 per barrel, both iron ore and gold fell just over 1%.</p>
<p><strong>Broker Ratings</strong></p>
<p>OZ Minerals <a href="/stock-information/OZL">OZL</a> maintained as neutral at BoA Merrill Lynch<br />WorleyParsons <a href="/stock-information/WOR">WOR</a> has its rating increased by Morningstar</p>
<p class="h1"> </p>
<p class="h1">Market Summary April 23rd 2013</p>
<p>The Australian share market had a great start this morning and held onto most of the gains even after disappointing China data from the HSBC and ended above the 5000 point mark with the ASX 200 up 49.6 points to 5016.2.  The Australian dollar fell further to 1.024 on the news.  At time of publishing Europe has started positively with most market up around 1/3 of a per cent.</p>
<p>Today Woodside Petroleum <a href="/stock-information?code=wpl">WPL</a> led the gains finishing up 9.7 per cent to 37.96 after announcing a special dividend and the future outlook on capital management.  The price appreciation continues on the theme the investors are after stocks with high yield and have a strong earnings profile.</p>
<p>Banking, finance and telecommunications sectors did well with the major banks finishing higher with ANZ <a href="/stock-information?code=anz">ANZ</a> leading the pack up 2.4% to $29.25.  Once again investors wanting those fat dividends. Telstra <a href="/stock-information?code=tls">TLS</a> was also higher at $4.84.</p>
<p>Retailers also did well with JB Hifi <a href="/stock-information?code=jbh">JBH</a> up 2 per cent to $15.92, Myer <a href="/stock-information?code=myr">MYR</a> up 3.6% to 3.17, Wesfarmers <a href="/stock-information?code=wes">WES</a> and Woolworths <a href="/stock-information?code=wow">WOW</a> up 2.79% to 43.04 and 1.67% to $35.98 respectively</p>
<p>With Italian and Spain bond yields continuing to fall and the price of oil on the rise, it appears that markets may drift higher with positive earnings momentum in the US. Apple reports tonight in the US and may provide some movement either way.</p>
<p class="h1"> </p>
<p class="h1">Woodside pumps out the Special Dividend cash</p>
<p>As rumored after putting the browse expansion on the back burner, Woodside Petroleum <a href="/stock-information?code=wpl">WPL</a> has announced a special dividend of 63 cents fully franked.  As well as the special dividend, management under the direction of Michael Chaney as chairman, ex CEO of Wesfarmers <a href="/stock-information?code=wes">WES</a> has upped the payout ratio for Woodside to 80% of profits.  This is likely to be around $2.20 per year for the full year 2014.  Even based on today’s move higher of 8% to around $37 per share, the 2014 dividend would be 8.4% on a gross yield.</p>
<p>To us this seems cheap given that Woodside has access to very cheap financing for growth in the US, Israel, Myanmar and East Timor.  Browse may come back with a different building option which could provide a long term kicker.  In the meantime, you’re getting paid to wait with big fat dividends.</p>
<p class="h1"> </p>
<p class="h1">Morning Report April 23rd 2013</p>
<p>Wall street was up overnight with the Dow up 19 points to 14,567, SP 500 up 8 points to 1,563 and Nasdaq up 28 points to 3,234. In noteable news Catapillar came in with below market estimates and downgraded their full year outlook, this continues a string of news that points to soft materials sector. Netflix suprised late in the day with earnings estimates much higer than anticipated and in aftermarket the stock was up over 20%. Microsoft has a new activist shareholder after a hedge fund bought $2Billion dollars worth of stock. This may add weight to the argument Ballmer has to go.</p>
<p>The Austrlian dollar was lower at 1.0267 and the SPI future finised up 13 points which should provide some postives moves at the open. Today the HSBC releases its China purchasing managers' index for April. This may have some significant influnce on the way our market trades today. Brent oil was up to 100.38 dollar per barrel but is still down for the week and copper continues to fall in price, down 1 percent to $6965 a tonne.</p>

<p class="h1">The Big Golden Correction</p>
<p>Since trade in New York on friday night, the gold price has fallen like the heavy item it is.  The price on the day fell below $1500 per ounce a fall of around 5%, and then again in asian trade down a further 3%.  Is this the end of the extrodinary run since 2001? </p>
<p>I'd like to draw your attention to Warren Buffett's letter to shareholders in 2011.</p>
<p>Today the world’s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it would form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At $1,750 per ounce – gold’s price as I write this – its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A. Let’s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world’s most profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?</p>
<p>Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today’s annual production of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers – whether jewelry and industrial users, frightened individuals, or speculators – must continually absorb this additional supply to merely maintain an equilibrium at present prices.</p>
<p>A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops – and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The 170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can fondle the cube, but it will not respond.</p>
<p>Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it’s likely many will still rush to gold. I’m confident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century at a rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.</p>]]></content>

      <description><![CDATA[Dividend Investing]]></description>
      <content><![CDATA[<p class="h3">Dividend Basics</p>
<p>One of the ways a company will reward it's shareholders is by paying out a dividend. Dividends are distributions that are paid using profits that a company has made during the year.</p>
<p>Dividend yield is simply your rate of return from the dividend payouts, exclusive of any stock price appreciation. It's calculated by dividing the dividends you receive over a year's time by the price you paid for the stock.</p>
<p>I'll give you an example: Your dividend yield is 5% if you paid $20 per share, and you receive $1 per share in dividends ($1/$20) over the 12 months following your purchase.</p>
<p>Dividend yield, however, is not a fixed number. It changes along with the share price. For instance, say someone else buys the same stock a week later when the share price had moved up to $25. Instead of 5%, their dividend yield would only be 4% ($1/$25).</p>
<p class="h3 normal">Franked Dividends, Franking Credits and the Dividend Imputation System Explained</p>
<p><strong>What is the dividend imputation system?</strong></p>
<p>The dividend imputation system was introduced by the Hawke/Keating government in 1987. Generally when a company earns profit, they will pay this out to their shareholders in the form of a dividend. Just like you or I, companies are required to pay tax on money earned, unlike the individual though, the company corporate tax rate is a flat 30%.</p>
<p>Before the dividend imputation system was introduced, the tax office would tax both the companies and the investor, even though this money has already been taxed, so it was a form of double taxing. With the introduction of the dividend imputation system, investors who receive dividends will now only be taxed the difference between 30% and their own marginal tax rate since the company has already paid the 30% tax. So if your individual tax rate is 30% then you will not have to pay tax on the dividends, i.e. the dividend is tax free. If your marginal tax rate is above 30%, say 46.5%, then you will pay the difference, 16.5%.</p>
<p>Since 2000, franking credits became fully refundable, for example let's assume you didn't earn any taxable income for a particular year, if you received a dividend of $700, then not only is the money tax free, you will also receive a refund of $300 from the ATO.</p>
<p><strong>Franking Credits Explained</strong></p>
<p>The dividend imputation system allows investors who have been paid a dividend to take a personal tax credit (franking credit) since the company has already paid tax (30%) on this dividend.</p>
<p>For example;</p>
<p>Let say company XYZ makes $1.00 profit. Company XYZ is required to pay corporate tax at the rate of 30% on this $1 profit. So if a company is paying franked dividends then the 30% that has already been taxed ($0.30) can be used to offset your taxable income in the form of a franking credit.</p>
<p>How does the franking credit system work?</p>
<p>So company XYZ makes $1.00 profit and is required to pay corporate tax at the rate of 30% on this $1 profit. Consequently the taxed $0.30 (30% of $1) will be paid in cash to the tax office and the company then records this $0.30 into their franking account. The franking account is only a record of what was paid and does not contain actual money. The company's ability to frank its dividend will depend on the balance of this franking account. If the franking credit contains a surplus, the company may declare a fully franked (100% franked) dividend. If the franking account isn't large enough, perhaps because it pays tax overseas, then the company may declare a partially franked dividend. If company XYZ does not make any profit it will pay no tax. Since it pays no tax the franking account will be empty and any dividends the company declares will be unfranked. How can a company pay a dividend if it makes no profit? The reason is because only a percentage of the profit actually gets paid out to investors, a company may tap into their reserve cash to pay dividend. Unfranked dividends are treated entirely as income by the tax department. This income is taxed at your marginal tax rate.</p>
<p>Around 52% of the companies in the ASX offers fully franked dividends *source choice magazine</p>
<p><strong>Fully Franked Dividends: Tax, Yields &amp; Franking credits calculations</strong></p>
<p>Here is an example of what the tax implications are of franking credits. We will also compare franked dividend yields versus term deposit/fixed interest yield. Let's take a real life example;</p>
<p>Suppose you had 625 units of shares in ANZ. ANZ share price is $16 and they announce a fully franked (100%) dividend of $1.20 per share</p>
<p>Total invested: 625 X $16 = $10,000<br />Fully franked dividend income: 1.20 X 625 = $750<br />Franking credit formula: total cash dividend X 30/70*<br />* assuming corporate tax rate of 30%</p>
<p>Lets assume that your marginal tax rate is 45 percent plus a medicare levy (1.5%), total tax rate is 46.5%.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the franking calculation above we can see the benefits of the dividend imputation system. The fully franked credits has lowered the investors overall tax rate from 46.5% to 23.57% (100-(573.22/750)).</p>
<p><strong>Comparing this to a term deposit or fixed interest</strong></p>
<p>Lets compare the yield of a fully franked dividend to a term deposit or fixed interest account earning the equivalent 7.5%. This is essentially the above example without the franking credits</p>
<p>Term deposit/Fixed term interest<br />Investment: $10,000<br />Total income: $750<br />Tax payable at 46.5%:<br />After tax income: $348.75<br />Income Yield: 3.49% (348.75/10,000)</p>
<p>So if we compare a fully frank dividend and fixed interest investment, both at 7.5%, we find that the fully franked share dividend is the much superior investment, yielding 5.73% versus 3.49%. For a fixed interest investment to earn the equivalent after tax income, it would need to yield 12.33%</p>
<p><strong>Partially Franked Dividends</strong></p>
<p>Let's look at the same example above but this time the ANZ dividends will be partially franked at 80%</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The partially franked imputation credit has effectively reduced the investor's tax rate from 46.5% to 28.16%</p>
<p>Franking credits at different tax rates</p>
<p>The benefits of the dividend imputation system. For the examples below we will use a dividend of $700.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The 45 day rule</strong></p>
<p>As the examples have shown fully franked dividends and franking credits make investing in Australian shares a tax effective strategy. However, the ATO realises this and to prevent investors from abusing the system they introduced the 45 day rule. The 45 day rule states that shareholder must hold shares for 45 days (not counting days of purchase or sale) for any franking credits over $5,000.</p>
<p>A word of warning before you decide to put your life savings into chasing shares with high dividends. While high yielding dividends may look enticing it would be useless if those shares plummet in value (falling capital gains). Always research the company and look for strong fundamentals, for example what does the company's dividend history look like? Are the dividends growing year on year in line with the earnings per share? Is there long term potential for this company? Will earnings rise in the near term as they have a new project which will come online?</p>

            <uBlogsyContentSummary><![CDATA[Market Summary April 24th 2013]]></uBlogsyContentSummary>
            <uBlogsyContentBody><![CDATA[<p>The Aussie market was on fire today up 86 points to close at 5,102 points.  The talk of further rate cutting and a good lead from overseas on profit results help lift the financials to grind higher.  The Dollar was flat for the day and at the time of publishing, Europe has opened mostly flat.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank <a href="/stock-information/cba">CBA</a>, ANZ <a href="/stock-information/anz">ANZ</a>, Westpac Bank <a href="/stock-information/WBC">WBC</a>, and National Australia Bank, <a href="/stock-information/nab">NAB</a> were up between 2.2 and 2.4%.  A shot in the arm from interest rate speculation and with ANZ <a href="/stock-information/anz">ANZ</a> reporting profits early next week has provided good gains for dividend investors.</p>
<p>Mining and Energy sectors were also up with BHP Billiton <a href="/stock-information/bhp">BHP</a> up 1% to $31.70, Rio Tinto <a href="/stock-information/rio">RIO</a> up 1.3% to $54.68.  Woodside <a href="/stock-information/wpl">WPL</a> again was up 2.1% to $38.74 giving investors further cheer.</p>
<p>Retail also fared well with Harvey Norman <a href="/stock-information/hvn">HVN</a> rising over 4% for two days in a row.  Myer <a href="/stock-information/myr">MYR</a>, JB Hifi <a href="/stock-information/JBH">JBH</a> and David Jones <a href="/stock-information/DJS">DJS</a> were also higher, with The Reject Shop <a href="/stock-information/TRS">TRS</a> up 7.8% to $18.02 after announcing a share placement to help fund its growth plans.</p>
<p>With tomorrow being ANZAC day it gives us a day to reflect on the things that matter and the people who have sacrificed all they have for us. </p>]]></uBlogsyContentBody>

            <uBlogsyContentBody><![CDATA[<p>Wall street was up strongly overnight and European markets were much higher with euro indexs up over 2% on much lower Italian and Spanish bond yields. The Dow, Nasdaq and SP 500 finished 14,719 3.269 and 1,579 respectivily broadly all 1% higher. US banks were higher and after the bell Yum Brands beat estimates and Apple increased its dividned to shareholders and increasing its buyback to $50 Billion. During the day a fake tweet about a bomb going off in the white house caused the market to drop over 100 points, but a few minutes later all the points were regained.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar was slightly higher at 1.026 and the SPI futures are up around 50 points which sounds like a great day ahead. Woodside might further be in the news today with its AGM being held in Perth later today.

            <uBlogsyContentSummary><![CDATA[Woodside puts out a special 63c fully franked dividend.]]></uBlogsyContentSummary>
            <uBlogsyContentBody><![CDATA[<p>Woodside pumps out the special dividend cash</p>
<p>As rumored after putting the browse expansion on the back burner, Woodside Petroleum <a href="/stock-information?code=wpl">WPL</a> has announced a special dividend of 63 cents fully franked.  As well as the special dividend, management under the direction of Michael Chaney as chairman, ex CEO of Wesfarmers <a href="/stock-information?code=wes">WES</a> has upped the payout ratio for Woodside to 80% of profits.  This is likely to be around $2.20 per year for the full year 2014.  Even based on today’s move higher of 8% to around $37 per share, the 2014 dividend would be 8.4% on a gross yield.  </p>
<p>To us this seems cheap given that Woodside has access to very cheap financing for growth in the US, Israel, Myanmar and East Timor.  Browse may come back with a different building option which could provide a long term kicker.  In the meantime, you’re getting paid to wait with big fat dividends.</p>]]></uBlogsyContentBody>

In noteable news Catapillar came in with below market estimates and downgraded their full year outlook, this continues a string of news that points to soft materials sector. Netflix suprised late in the day with earnings estimates much higer than anticipated and in aftermarket the stock was up over 20%. Microsoft has a new activist shareholder after a hedge fund bought $2Billion dollars worth of stock. This may add weight to the argument Ballmer has to go.</p>
<p>The Austrlian dollar was lower at 1.0267 and the SPI future finised up 13 points which should provide some postives moves at the open. Today the HSBC releases its China purchasing managers' index for April. This may have some significant influnce on the way our market trades today. Brent oil was up to 100.38 dollar per barrel but is still down for the week and copper continues to fall in price, down 1 percent to $6965 a tonne.</p>

            <uBlogsyContentSummary><![CDATA[Market Summary 22nd April 2013 at the end of trade]]></uBlogsyContentSummary>
            <uBlogsyContentBody><![CDATA[<p>The Australian sharemarket pushed higher, after strong leads from overseas equity markets and a stabalising gold price, as defensive stocks continued to perform and resources companies had a strong day.</p>
<p>The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index closed 34.7 points, or 0.7 per cent, higher at 4966.6 points.</p>
<p>On a day that lacked important economic data and market-driving news, the banks continued their ascent.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank of Australia was up 55¢ at $69.33, while Westpac Banking Corporation rose 9¢ to $31.32.</p>
<p>ANZ Banking Group gained 16¢ to $28.57 and National Australia Bank lifted 19¢ to $31.64.</p>
<p>“If we understand what’s actually happening here, it’s clear that much of the bond market is shifting into equities,” said Credit Suisse equity strategist Damien Boey.</p>
<p>“But investors are being very selective and looking at those assets that are bond proxies and have defensive earning qualities. That includes the banks.”</p>
<p>Telecommunications giant Telstra was flat at $4.76, after reaching near five-year highs last week.</p>
<p>The demand for companies with defensive earning qualities was shown by the performance of the healthcare sector on Monday.</p>
<p>Ramsay Health Care jumped 2.3 per cent to $31.86, Cochlear advanced 2 per cent to $63.39 and Sonic Healthcare lifted 2.5 per cent to $13.16.</p>
<p>Northward Capital portfolio manager Simon Rutherfurd said healthcare companies had generally exhibited strong earnings growth but this was often implicit in share prices.</p>
<p>“There are a number of healthcare names that continue to do quite well, but they are pretty well recognised in terms of their (price-earnings) multiples,” he said. “They are pretty highly rated for their earnings certainty, but it depends on how badly you want to own them.”</p>
<p>Against mixed performance for commodity prices, the country’s two biggest resources companies made gains.</p>
<p>BHP Billiton was up 1 per cent at $31.72 while Rio Tinto lifted 1.5 per cent to $55.12.</p>
<p>Gold rose up by 1.1 per cent to $US1419.85 in Asian trading on Monday afternoon, after a horror run last week,</p>
<p>On Friday, copper was down by 1.4 per cent and iron ore was down by 0.4 per cent to $US138.</p>
<p>“There has been some pretty heaving selling in the energy and resources sectors, which may have been a bit overdone,” Mr Rutherfird said. “There’s quite a few headwinds going against the resources companies, with a worrying demand outlook from China and falling commodity prices.”</p>
<p>The recent catalyst for losses among resources companies was weaker-than-expected Chinese growth data released this month.</p>
<p>An extension of the softness in resources companies, has been the mining services sector.</p>
<p>Boart Longyear jumped 7.2 per cent to 97¢, after plunging nearly 30 per cent last week.</p>
<p>Bradken fell 5.7 per cent to $5.12 and Ausdrill dropped 2.1 per cent to $1.64.</p>
<p>Karara Capital portfolio manager Rohan Walsh said mining services companies were suffering because the outlook for major resources projects had weakened.</p>
<p>“There’s defiantly a concern about profitability among mining companies and therefore their ability and desire to invest further,” he said. “There’s a clear expectation that the level of activity in the mining sector will be reduced, which will flow onto the mining services sector.”</p>
<p>This month Woodside Petroleum shelved its plan for $45 billion onshore liquefied natural gas project at James Point Price, Western Australia.</p>
<p>In the dairy sector, Murray Goulburn Co-operative raised its stake in rival dairy processor Warrnambool Cheese to 16.3 per cent.</p>
<p>Murray Goulburn last week lifted its holding from 12 per cent to 14.5 per cent and publicly stated it would continue buying shares on market at $4.60 a share until it reached a 19.9 per cent holding.</p>
<p>Warrnambool was up 2¢ at $4.12 and has risen 14.4 per cent for the year.</p>]]></uBlogsyContentBody>
